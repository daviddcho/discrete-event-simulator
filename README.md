# Discrete Event Simulator
A [discrete event simulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete-event_simulation) models the operation of a system as a discrete sequence of events in time.
This particular DES models how the operating system organizes and orders the use of its resources. This simulation can help give some understanding on how processes move through a computing system. 

## Usage 
```
git clone https://github.com/daviddcho/discrete-event-simulator.git
make && ./mysim
```
## Diagram 
This diagram shows the flow of how processes move through the different events in its execution history.
